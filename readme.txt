Given that I pay the mortgage 12 times a year, but I get paid
26 times a year. That means that most of the time it take 2
pay periods worth to pay the mortgage, but there are 2 periods
through the year where there are 3 pay deposits between due
mortgage payments.

Given that it take 3 days to transfer money from the bank to
the mortgage company, spreadsheet attempts to find when are the
2 pay times in the year when pay does not have to go to the
mortgage.

Sheet is setup for 2014

the payment to the mortgage company.
